\&\fB\s-1CASE\s0 A)\fR to build Cygwin Net Release from a package that includes a standard
\&\f(CW\*(C`./configure\*(C'\fR script, the quick path for porting would be in the fortunate
case as simple as running commands:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $ mkdir -p /tmp/build && rm /tmp/build/*
\&    $ cd /tmp/build
\&    $ mv /download/path/package-N.N.tar.gz .

.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    ... If you have GPG key, you can add options -s "SignerKeyID"
\&    ... -p "pass phrase" to commands 'package', 'source-package' and
\&    ... 'publish'.
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 14
\&    $ cygbuild -r 1 makedirs
\&    $ cygbuild -r 1 files

.PP
To make this easier, a (b)uild alias will help. The option \fB\-r\fR is
mandatory almost for all commands:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $ alias b="cygbuild -s F701D4B3 -r"    # Save this in ~/.bashrc

.PP
\&\fB\s-1CASE\s0 B)\fR If the downloaded Cygwin source release package is
controlled by cygbuild, then commands \fB[all]\fR and \fB[almostall]\fR can
be used to check the binary build:
.PP
.Vb 4

.Ve
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-bzip2\fR" 4
.IX Item "--bzip2"
Use bzip2 compression instead of default \fIgzip\fR\|(1). This affects the
manual pages and the usr/share/doc/*/ content.
.IP "\fB\-c|\-\-color\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c|--color"
Activate colors in displayed messages.
.IP "\fB\-\-cygbuiddir \s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--cygbuiddir DIR"
\&\s-1PATH\s0 where all the temporaqry files are kept; object files, taking diffs
etc. The default value is \f(CW\*(C`./.build\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-cyginstdir \s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--cyginstdir DIR"
\&\s-1PATH\s0 where \f(CW\*(C`make install\*(C'\fR will install the source package's executable
files, documentation files etc. The default value is \f(CW\*(C`./.inst\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-cygsinstdir \s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--cygsinstdir DIR"
\&\s-1PATH\s0 where ready Cygwin Net Release packages and patch files are put.
etc. The default value is \f(CW\*(C`./.sinst\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-d|\-\-debug \s-1LEVEL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d|--debug LEVEL"
Turn on debug. Usually means running external shell files with \-x
enabled.
.IP "\fB\-e|\-\-email \s-1EMAIL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e|--email EMAIL"
Set email address to use with commad \fB[readmefix]\fR. This effectively sets
variable \f(CW\*(C`CYGBUILD_EMAIL\*(C'\fR that is written to 'maintained by' section of
\&\f(CW\*(C`package.README\*(C'\fR file.
.IP "\fB\-g|\-\-gbs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g|--gbs"
Activate g\-b-s compatibility mode \*(-- that is \*(-- behave like Cygwin Build
Script. This changes behavior and command in the following manner:
.RS 4
.IP "commands: \fB[all]\fR, \fB[binary\-package]\fR and \fB[source\-packagage]\fR" 4
.IX Item "commands: [all], [binary-package] and [source-packagage]"
Move the generated source package \f(CW\*(C`package\-N.N.tar.bz2\*(C'\fR and binary package
\&\f(CW\*(C`package\-N.N\-src.tar.bz2\*(C'\fR to one directory up \f(CW\*(C`../\*(C'\fR instead the default
location <./sinst>.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fB\-f|\-\-file \s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f|--file FILE"
Specify package file and version, like \f(CW\*(C`foo\-1.11.tar.gz\*(C'\fR from which the
\&\s-1VERSION\s0 and possible \s-1RELEASE\s0 numbers can be derived. This option is needed
only if the current directory is not in format \f(CW\*(C`package\-version\*(C'\fR. Problems
in 99% of the cases are in the source file names. See 'Packages with
non-standard versioning schemes' how to deal with unusual packages when
doing porting.
.Sp
This option comes handy with command \fB[check]\fR when someone else's
binary package results are being checked. An example:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&  $ ls
\&    foo-2.1.tar.gz
\&    foo-2.1-1.tar.bz2
\&    foo-2.1-1-src.tar.bz2
\&  ... make "pseudo" install directory
\&  $ mkdir .inst
\&  ... examine the binary package
\&  $ (cd .inst ; tar -jxvf ../foo-2.1-1.tar.bz2)
\&  $ cygbuild -f foo-2.1-1.tar.bz2 --cyginstdir .inst --verbose check
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-h\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h"
Print program's internal short help.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print long help (this page).
.IP "\fB\-\-init\-pkgdb \s-1PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--init-pkgdb PATH"
In order for command \fB[check\-deps]\fR to be able to determine correct
dependencies for \f(CW\*(C`setup.hint\*(C'\fR section \fIrequires:\fR, an external database
must be generated. The package database will include directory listings
from all \f(CW\*(C`package\-N.N\-N.tar.bz2\*(C'\fR files. This initial creation will take
\&\s-1VERY\s0 \s-1LONG\s0 time because every installed \f(CW\*(C`*.bz2\*(C'\fR file must be examined. If
unsure what the \s-1PATH\s0 argument should be, start \fBsetup.exe\fR and see value
\&\fILocal Package Directory\fR which stores the downloaded packages.
.Sp
When the database is available, it makes finding dependencies automatic
from the \f(CW\*(C`cygcheck BIN\*(C'\fR listing like this:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    D:/cygwin/bin/ls.exe
\&      D:\ecygwin\ebin\ecygwin1.dll
\&        C:\eWINNT\esystem32\eADVAPI32.DLL
\&          C:\eWINNT\esystem32\eNTDLL.DLL
\&          C:\eWINNT\esystem32\eKERNEL32.DLL
\&          C:\eWINNT\esystem32\eRPCRT4.DLL
\&      D:\ecygwin\ebin\ecygintl-3.dll
\&        D:\ecygwin\ebin\ecygiconv-2.dll
.Ve
.Sp
After the command is run. Program terminates and rest of the commands
are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-\-install\-prefix \s-1PREXIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--install-prefix PREXIX"
Set custom install \s-1PREFIX\s0. The value must be path (no leading slash)
relative to install dir \f(CW\*(C`./.sinst\*(C'\fR. The default is to install using prefix
value \fIusr\fR, which puts files in directories like:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    usr/bin
\&    usr/share/doc
\&    ...
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-install\-usrlocal\fR" 4
.IX Item "--install-usrlocal"
Arrange all relevant prefixes to use \f(CW\*(C`usr/local\*(C'\fR install structure instead
of the default \f(CW\*(C`usr\*(C'\fR. With this option the packages created are suitable
for private installation. Keep this option with every command, so that
program knows about the special port:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    cygbuild --release 1 --install-usrlocal CMD ...
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-m|\-\-nomore\-space\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m|--nomore-space"
No more space (on disk). This option affects the [mkpatch] command when it
is run. The patch process would start by calling 'make clean' followed by
\&'make distclean' before taking a diff between the modified sources and the
original sources. But trashing an hours worth of compiled \f(CW\*(C`*.o\*(C'\fR files
would be waste if package were to be rebuilt again. So, the default
behavior for mkpatch is that it takes a snapshot \fBcopy\fR of current
modified sources andtakes them to /tmp where the 'clean' is done. This way
the original *.o files are kept intact.
.Sp
If you do not have the room for a large compilation tree, then notify
program with option \fB\-\-nomore\-space\fR that you do not have the space
needed to make the copy. In this case the 'make clean' is run on current
sources.
.ie n .IP "\fB\-p|\-\-passphrase ""\s-1PASS\s0 \s-1PHRASE\s0""\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\-p|\-\-passphrase ``\s-1PASS\s0 \s-1PHRASE\s0''\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p|--passphrase PASS PHRASE"
Signing pass phrase. In multiuser environment, consider security carefully
before using this option.
.IP "\fB\-P|\-\-Prefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P|--Prefix"
Command \fB[install]\fR supposes standard \s-1GNU\s0 \f(CW\*(C`./configure\*(C'\fR where variable
\&\s-1DESTDIR\s0 points to a root directory of installation. All packages do not
include \s-1DESTDIR\s0. A \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR may e.g. solely use variable \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR to do
the same. Look into \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR if it looks something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    prefix      = /usr/local             << Note: Absolute path here
\&    exec_prefix = ${prefix}
\&    mandir      = ${prefix}/man
\&    bindir      = ${exec_prefix}/bin
.Ve
.Sp
If so, with option \fB\-P\fR variable \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR is changed instead of \s-1DESTDIR\s0.
The installation process is then able to put files under
\&\f(CW\*(C`package\-N.N/.inst/\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR This options should be avoided and it may be removed. Currently
program tries to detect if \s-1DESTDIR\s0 is supported by the Makefile and if not,
automatically turn on option \fB\-P\fR. In practice it is better to modify
\&\f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR and add the \f(CW\*(C`DESTDIR\*(C'\fR and change \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR variable manually
into:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    DESTDIR         =
\&    prefix          = /usr
\&    exec_prefix     = $(prefix)
\&    man_prefix      = $(prefix)/share
\&    bindir          = $(DESTDIR)$(exec_prefix)/bin
\&    mandir          = $(DESTDIR)$(man_prefix)/man/man1
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-r|\-\-release \s-1RELEASE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r|--release RELEASE"
This option is required option by almost all commands.
.Sp
Specify build release: 1, 2, 3 etc. If this is word \*(L"date\*(R", then derive
build number from \fIdate\fR\|(1) in format \s-1YYYYMMDDHHMM\s0
.IP "\fB\-s|\-\-sign \s-1SIGNKEY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s|--sign SIGNKEY"
Gpg key to use for signing. It is best to use the hexadecimal unique key
id to avoid picking the wrong key from keyring. See \f(CW\*(C`gpg \-\-list\-keys\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-t|\-\-test\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t|--test"
Run in test mode. This option is respected when \fB[install]\fR command is
run: no actual changes or install is done. This is good way to check that
Makefile doesn't mistakenly install to system directories.
.IP "\fB\-v|\-\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v|--verbose"
Print more informational messages.
.IP "\fB\-V|\-\-version|\-\-Version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V|--version|--Version"
Print version number.
.IP "\fB\-x|\-\-no\-strip\fR" 4

Do not strip executables or check strip status before command \fB[package]\fR.
Use this option if package contains only interpreted files like Perl,
Python or Shell scripts etc.

The prefix 'lib' is not added in front of \s-1PACKAGE\s0 if \s-1PACKAGE\s0 name already
starts with string 'lib'. In order to make a library release, there must be
separate setup hint files for each in dicrectory \f(CW\*(C`CYGWIN\-PATCHES/\*(C'\fR.

Take for example a sample garbage collection library, whose name is simply
\&'gc' available at <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm>. There
are no executable files in. You should not use the name \f(CW\*(C`gc\*(C'\fR to package
this. The problem is the initial unpack directory name \f(CW\*(C`gc\-6.2.1.6\*(C'\fR which
is used to generate the package names. The following is not optimal:
.Sp

This program builds Cygwin binary and source packages. Refer to \fICygwin
Package Contributor's Guide\fR at http://cygwin.com/setup.html for more
information about the details of packaging phase. Due to complex nature of
various source packages out there, it is impossible to completely automate
the packaging steps. Some manual work will always be needed. The hairy
ports are those that have very vague and misbehaving \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR which
install files to all over the system and distribute copies of files with
\&\fIcp\fR\|(1) instead of \fIinstall\fR\|(1). Ahem, you as \*(L"the porter\*(R", know the
drill and have to use your hands to \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR mud tar pit. Solid
\&\f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR experience is therefore a requirement before thinking to port
any packages to Cygwin.
.PP
If \fIgpg\fR\|(1) is installed, the patch, binary and source package can be
cryptographically signed. See options \fB\-\-sign\fR and \fB\-\-passphrase\fR.
.Sh "Packages with no version number"
.IX Subsection "Packages with no version number"
To port a package which does not have a version number, one has to be
generated out of the blue. Program relies on the fact that the \s-1VERSION\s0 is
available both in the original package name and in the unpack directory.
The package extensions can be \f(CW\*(C`.gz\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`*.bz2\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`*.tgz\*(C'\fR. The recognized
package filename formats include:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package-N[.N]+.tar.gz                Universal packaging format
\&    package_N[.N]+.orig.tar.gz           Debian source packages
.Ve
.PP
Like in here:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    foo-1.2.tar.gz, foo-0.0.2.tar.bz2, foo-12.0.2.1.tgz
.Ve
.PP
The package name can consist of many words separated by hyphens:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    package-name-long-N[.N]+.tar.gz         Uses hyphens only
\&    package_name_invalid-N[.N]+.tar.gz      Underscores not allowed
.Ve
.PP
In case file uses some other naming and numbering scheme, it's a problem.
Similarly if the unpack directory structure does not use universal scheme
\&\f(CW\*(C`package\-N.N\*(C'\fR, it's a problem. Suppose a package unpacks like this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    $ tar zxvf package-beta-latest.tar.gz
\&        ...
\&        package-latest
\&        package-latest/src
\&        package-latest/doc
.Ve
.PP
The situation can be coped by making a symbolic link to whatever is
appropriate for the version number. If unsure, pick a \s-1YYYYMMDD\s0 in case
there is no relevant version that can be used for the package.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ ln -s package-beta-latest.tar.gz package-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
\&    $ ln -s package-latest/ package-YYYYMMDD/
.Ve
.PP

7. Building source packages is much harder, because the program needs to
know more details about configure and build phases. If the default source
packaging command \fB[source\-package]\fR does not succeed, you probably have
to guide the process slightly by the shell scripts provided under directory

Does everything look good? No. Documentation appears to be installed twice.
In this case it is due to fact that cybuild.sh always runs it's own default
install for files under package's \f(CW\*(C`doc/\*(C'\fR directory. But if run \*(L"make
install\*(R" also does the same, it's a problem as in this case. The target
directory was just a little different. The documentation must appear in
directory \f(CW\*(C`usr/share/doc/\*(C'\fR and not \f(CW\*(C`usr/doc/\*(C'\fR over, so the
\&\f(CW\*(C`install\-after.sh\*(C'\fR script's work is to remove the extra files:
.Sp

The \fB[install]\fR command runs series of install phases. After all the
Cygwin documentation is copied to directory \f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/doc/foo\-1.12\*(C'\fR, the
standard \f(CW\*(C`make install\*(C'\fR phase is run. If you need to set any environment
variables or arrange other things, do it in this file. It will be called
like
.Sp
.Vb 1

If you need exotic 'make install' options, this is the place to configure.
For example, if \f(CW\*(C`Makefile\*(C'\fR does not use \fI\s-1DESTDIR\s0\fR option, but a variable
\&\fI\s-1INSTALLROOT\s0\fR, you can add that to 'make install' by defining generic
\&\f(CW\*(C`CYGBUILD_MAKEFLAGS\*(C'\fR make option. This works, because variables
\&\f(CW$instdir\fR and \f(CW$PREFIX\fR are set in the program and contain the needed
information.

The \fB[install]\fR command runs series of install phases. In the first, The
Cygwin documentation for package directory \f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/doc/foo\-1.12\*(C'\fR is
populated from files in the original package. Those of \s-1INSTALL\s0, \s-1COPYRIGHT\s0
and \s-1README\s0 are copied. Then any \f(CW\*(C`doc/\*(C'\fR directory if it is included. The
default rules exclude most common files MANIFESt, *.bak, *.rej etc. and
version control subdirectories.
.Sp
In this file it is possible to supply extra tar options to exclude more
files not to be included. Perhaps package's \f(CW\*(C`doc/\*(C'\fR directory contains
subdirectories that are targetted to software developers porting the

Normally command \fB[clean]\fR would be run along with the standard
preparations. The purpose of the clean is to make sure the source package
did not mistankenly include precompiled files. If it did, that would later
prevent 'make' command to do nothing. Doing clean, makes it all pristine.
Sometimes, you may not want to allow clean to happen after source unpack,

containst the site wide setup:
.Sp
.Vb 1

The previous version of package \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR has put documentation in directories:

so the site wide configuration file could had come from the last
directory. Let's suppose upstream has put the example in:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    /usr/share/doc/foo-1.4/examples/foo.conf
.Ve
.Sp
When new version of package is about to be installed by \fIsetup.exe\fR, the

by \f(CW\*(C`preremove\-manifest.lst\*(C'\fR hasn't been changed from the package's
upstream examples listed in <preremove\-manifest\-from.lst> which now can
simply read:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $PKGDOCDIR/examples/foo.conf
.Ve
.Sp
The special tag \f(CW\*(C`#PKGDOCDIR\*(C'\fR is just a shorthad pointer to the latest
documentation directory. If these two files do not differ, the
<preremove.sh> can safely delete \f(CW\*(C`/etc/foo.conf\*(C'\fR and let the

releases):
.PP

At first sight this may look complex, but with this structure you can
manage several packages easily. For each package, reserve a separate
directory where you do your work: \f(CW\*(C`foo/\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bar/\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`quux/\*(C'\fR etc. Download
orignal packages to these directories and upack the sources. Let's examine
package \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ cd /usr/src/cygwin-build/foo
\&    $ wget <URL>/foo-1.4.tar.gz

After unpack, you should see a clean directory name:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ tar zxvf foo-1.4.tar.gz
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    foo-1.4/
.Ve
.PP
Sometimes the packages unpacks to an uncommon directory:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    foo1.4b/
.Ve
.PP
Use previously recommended symlink approach to convert the name into more
standard form. Here the 'b' is minor release '2':
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ ln -s foo1.4b/ foo-1.4.2/
.Ve
.PP
There isn't much to do after that. You do your builds in the unpack
directories as usual. Supposing this is \*(L"standard\*(R" looking \s-1GNU\s0 package
which includes a \f(CW\*(C`./configure\*(C'\fR, making a Net release should be as simple
as running:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    $ cd foo-1.4/
\&    $ cygbuild files
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ...  Now edit files in CYGWIN-PATCHES/

.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1

With these commands, Cygwin Net release packages are copied one directory
up to the same place where the original compresses source kit is:

As Cywin is improved, the main library file \f(CW\*(C`cygwin1.dll\*(C'\fR may change and
periodically all packages must be rebuilt so that they link to the latest
function calls. In this case you have to rebuild every package you
maintain. Instead of going to every directory and typing the relevant
\&\*(L"cygbuild clean conf make install ..\*(R", there is a helper script that
automates the task. If you use the standard build layout as described in
previous topic, you can use rebuild sript to do the steps. Is is also a
good chance to verify that the package build process is repeatable:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    $ cygbuild-rebuild.sh -d /usr/src/cygwin-build -i 1 2>&1 | tee build.log
\&                           |                       |

\&                           directory where to start recursive build

If something goes wrong, you have to manually fix the package. Do not run
the rebuild script again until you have fixed the build process for a
broken package.

.Sh "Using preremove.sh and postinstall.sh for upgrading /etc files"
.IX Subsection "Using preremove.sh and postinstall.sh for upgrading /etc files"
The /etc directory is meant for configuraton files for programs. The first
installation typically copies the package's default setup file there but
subsequent installations won't overwrite existing files in order to
preserve user's modifications. If new version of the package includes new
features, those are not found from the \*(L"old\*(R" /etc configuration files.
.PP
Let's suppose user has not yet modified system wide configuration file
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/foo.conf\*(C'\fR and package includes newer one in
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/doc/foo\-1.2/foo.conf.example\*(C'\fR. In this case the installation
should copy the new example file over \f(CW\*(C`/etc/foo.conf\*(C'\fR to reflect possible
new features in the program.
.PP
The trick is to include a \fIpreremove.sh\fR script in the Cygwin Net Release
binary package. A file named \f(CW\*(C`/etc/preremove/foo.sh\*(C'\fR will be called just
before the package is uninstalled (setup.exe uninstalls the old version
before installing the upgraded version), so in that script, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/foo.conf\*(C'\fR exists and is identical to
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/share/doc/foo.conf.example\*(C'\fR, the \fIpreremove.sh\fR should delete it
and let \fIpostinstall.sh\fR install new one. If the \f(CW\*(C`/etc/foo.conf\*(C'\fR is
modified, it must be left alone.
.PP
Also, it is a good idea to have a file \f(CW\*(C`/etc/preremove/foo\-manifest.lst\*(C'\fR,
which lists every file that was created by the \fIpostinstall.sh\fR script,
and which will be removed on \fIpreremove.sh\fR if untouched by the user.
Someday, \f(CW\*(C`cygcheck \-c\*(C'\fR might parse the manifest lists to help diagnose if
postinstalls have not completed.

The install check did not find anything inside

binary packages. Check that directory \f(CW\*(C`package\-N.N/CYGWIN\-PATCHES/\*(C'\fR
includes files \f(CW\*(C`package.README\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`setup.hint\*(C'\fR which you must manually

You get following warning while making a binary package:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    -- Wait, reading and preparing variables based on current directory
\&    -- Hm, no *.exe or *.dll files, skipping strip.
\&    /usr/src/build/ask/package-1.1/.inst/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/package.README:1:<PKG>

The warning means, that file \f(CW\*(C`CYGWIN\-PATCHES/package.README\*(C'\fR was not
modified before command \fB[install]\fR was run. Edit \f(CW\*(C`package.README\*(C'\fR file
and leave all <\s-1PKG\s0> <\s-1VER\s0> <\s-1REL\s0> tags alone. Then run \fB[package]\fR followed
by command \fB[readmefix]\fR which is able to fix these tags automatically.
.Sh "While making source package, the mkpatch step dies with an error"
.IX Subsection "While making source package, the mkpatch step dies with an error"
Program uses predefined set of ignore rules to exclude binary files from
the difference comparison, but there is always a possibility that the
package you compiled generated files that are unknown. In those cases,
examine the diff output carefully, since the program will tell you:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    [ERROR] Making a patch failed, check /usr/src/foo-N.N/.sinst/foo-*.patch
.Ve
.PP
Now run this command to determine the problematic files in the \fIdiff\fR\|(1)
listing:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ egrep -n -i 'files.*differ' /usr/src/foo-N.N/.sinst/foo-*.patch
.Ve
.PP
To include more files to be excluded, send mail to maintainer if the files
are general enough to be detected as binary files. If files' extensions are
specific to the current package build add these to file \fIdiff.options\fR or
in diffifcult cases write custom \f(CW\*(C`CYGWIN\-PATCHES/diff.sh\*(C'\fR script. See
section \*(L"Optional external scripts\*(R" for more.

The application does not check the sanity of the command line
arguments. For example running commands in wrong order. It makes no
sense trying to make a binary \fIpackage\fR before the program has been
even built or installed.

The commands are always executed in listed order.
.Sh "Perl and double install is needed"
.IX Subsection "Perl and double install is needed"
If the archive you're porting is a perl module or program, the
\&\fB[install]\fR command unfortunately must be run twice. This is needed,
because in the first time, program writes
\&\f(CW\*(C`CYGWIN\-PATCHES/postinstall.sh\*(C'\fR file that handles announcing the
program to
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/lib/perl5/5.8.2/cygwin\-thread\-multi\-64int/perllocal.pod\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The next time the \fB[install]\fR is run, you will see this message,
because the file was already generated and program will not overwrite
existing postinstall:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    [WARN] Already exists, won't write to /usr/src/build/try/package-N.N/CYGWIN-PATCHES/postinstall.sh
.Ve
.PP
Ignore it, and check the contents of \f(CW\*(C`.inst/\*(C'\fR directory. After the
seconf \fB[install]\fR you should find the correct postinstall:

This porting tool only handles \f(CW\*(C`*.tar.gz\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`*.tar.bz2\*(C'\fR artchives. To
port e.g. a \f(CW\*(C`*.zip\*(C'\fR archive, you need to manually convert it to recognized
format:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    unzip foo-1.1.zip

.Sh "Slow program startup"
.IX Subsection "Slow program startup"
You may notice that the startup is a little slow. This is unavoidable due
to way the program determines what many global variables need to be
available at runtime. The method of checking environment is not
particularly smart (due to bash-scripting limitations in general; it has no
read function that could return multiple values), so this leads to calling
same checks of version and release numbers multiple times.

.IX Subsection "Cygwin postinstall script conventions"
If program X's \f(CW\*(C`postinstall\*(C'\fR is doing a \f(CW\*(C`cp\*(C'\fR, it does not preserve the \s-1ACL\s0
permissions. The \f(CW\*(C`postinstall\*(C'\fR script must be accompanied with \f(CWtouch(1)\fR
to create the new file before copying unto it or a call to \f(CW\*(C`chmod\*(C'\fR to set
reasonable permissions after the copying. If that's not done, the user may
end up having unreadable files. \s-1NOTE:\s0 \f(CW\*(C`cp \-p\*(C'\fR will not work, but \f(CW\*(C`install
