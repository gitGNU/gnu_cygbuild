Cygbuild - A porting tool for making Cygwin net releases
--------------------------------------------------------

Features not incomplete:

- Library packaging is *untested* and probably won't
  give expected results. The code needs real
  tests to properly generate *doc, *lib and *devel packages.

- Packaging directly from Version control checkout is *not* working.
  This idea will probably be removed. Use e.g. "git tar"
  to export repository and then proceed packaging as usual.

Features that are planned:

- Use gpg-agent (if running) for querying passwords.
