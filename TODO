Cygbuild - A porting tool for making Cygwin net releases
--------------------------------------------------------

Features to work on (in order of priority; highest first):

- Library packaging is *untested* and probably won't
  give expected results. The code is needs real
  tests to properly generate *doc, *lib and *devel packages.

- Packaging from Version control checkout is *not* working.
  The plan was skepthed long time ago, but I have now new
  ideas waiting for it.
