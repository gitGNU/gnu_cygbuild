Cygbuild - A porting tool for making Cygwin net releases
--------------------------------------------------------

In order of priority; highest first:

- Library packaging is *untested* and probably won't
  give expected results. The code needs real
  tests to properly generate *doc, *lib and *devel packages.

- Packaging from Version control checkout is *not* working.
  The plan was sketched long time ago.

- Use gpg-agent (if running) for querying passwords.
