Cygbuild - A porting tool for making Cygwin net releases
--------------------------------------------------------

Install instructions

    Running in place

        It is not mandatory to install anything. If you add the the
        package's bin/ directory to PATH, the program will search
        template files near the unpacked directories for template
        files.

    Cygwin binary package install

        If you received cygbuild in standard Cygwin binary archive format,
        it is installed by unpacking it at root directory:

            tar -C / -jxf <name-of-package.tar.bz2>

    Installing from a version control checkout:

        Details how to check out the project can ve found from project
        page. After checkout, various development commands can be
        listed with:

            make help

        The command `install-in-place' does not copy the files to but uses
        symbolic links that refer to current checkout location. The
	/usr/local is the default install without "prefix" parameter
	to make call:

            make [prefix=/usr/local] install-in-place

        After that, you only need to update the project from time to time
        from version control repository. After each checkout or update, you
        can update the templete files to their latest versions with:

            make install-etc
