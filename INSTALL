--------------------------------------------------------

Install instructions

    Standard install

        The /usr/local is the default install location:

            make [prefix=/usr] install

    Running in place

        It is not mandatory to install anything after unpack or
        version control checkout. The program will search needed
        files, provided that a) it is called by absolute name:

	    alias cb="/path/to/cygbuild.sh --color -s $GPGKEY"
	    cb <command and option ...>

	or b) package's bin/ directory is added to environment
        variable PATH.
