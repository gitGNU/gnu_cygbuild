Cygbuild - A porting tool for making Cygwin net releases
--------------------------------------------------------

Install instructions

    Cygwin binary package install

        If you received cygbuild in standard Cygwin binary archive
        format, it is installed by unpacking it at root directory:

            tar -C / -jxf <name-of-package.tar.bz2>

    Running in place

        It is not mandatory to install anything after unpack or
        version control checkout. The program will search needed
        files, provided that a) it is called by absolute name:

	    alias cb="/path/to/cygbuild.sh --color -s $GPGKEY"
	    cb <command and option ...>

	or b) package's bin/ directory is added to environment
        variable PATH.

    Standard install from a version control checkout

        Details how to check out the project can ve found from project
        page and README. From listing:

            make help

        There is command 'install-in-place' which uses symbolic links
        to current checkout location. The /usr/local is the default
        install location:

            make [prefix=/usr/local] install-in-place

End of file
