DESCRIPTION
    Program rebuilds all Cygwin Net release packages recursively starting
    from directory DIR. The directory structure layout must be same as
    outlined in cygbuild.1 manual section 'How to organize Cygwin Net
    Release builds'. Basicly, if DIR is /usr/src/cygwin-build/ the expected
    layout is:

         +--foo/
         |  |
         |  +--foo-1.3/
         |  +--foo-1.4/
         |
         +--bar/
            +--bar-3.12/
        ...

    Only the latest directories (like foo-1.4) will be rebuilt.

ENVIRONMENT
