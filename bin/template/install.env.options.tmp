# This file is 'sourced' just before 'make install'. Arrange any environment
# variables settings needed here. The call syntax is
#
#       source <this-file>
#
# If you want to pass extra flags, like INSTALLROOT, to 'make install', you
# can use program's variables $instdir and $CYGBUILD_PREFIX and define:
#
#       CYGBUILD_MAKEFLAGS="INSTALLROOT=$instdir$CYGBUILD_PREFIX"
